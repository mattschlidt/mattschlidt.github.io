			<h2>The Beginning of the End</h2>
				<p>	I am a graduate from Harvard. I have always believed in winning at the cost of others. In my life, there has never been anything such as a fair trade. Taking advantage of those around me is a common occurrence. Watch out, because when you are not looking, I will take every opportunity to steal from your open checkbook. I do not rob banks, I manipulate accounting sheets, I screw over business partners, and I always win. Or do I really? Every night I go to bed with this thought in my mind, I hope no one ever finds out. My habit of unconditionally winning started when I was 16. My brother and I started our first tech company called Banksy. The business model was to take peoples waste technology products and turn them into something valuable by fixing them or stripping them of there most valuable parts to sell to those in need. Over the next two years my brother and I would grow the business to have an annual revenue of $50,000, but I was not satisfied with this. When the business became one year old, I decided that I wanted more growth. I wanted recognition. Rather than being straightforward about out earnings, I decided to inflate a couple of accounting sheets. It all started with just one forged receipt. I remember exactly what it was, writing off Millimans employees old work phone purchases and amplifying the purchase and attributing our increased inventory as an expense to reduce our taxes. I figured that Uncle Sam would never know. Wow! This was so easy. At the time I was in the tax bracket of 25%, but by increasing our expense I realized that I could bring us down to the 20% tax bracket. What a relief. Besides, what were my taxes being used for anyway? To fight wars I did not believe in, to hire police that I did not respect, and to enforce laws that were meant to be broken.  </p>
			<h2> Greed </h2>
				<p>   So I started forging more and more receipts. Before I knew it, in one months time I was in the 20% tax bracket. I did not feel bad about a thing. I was just playing the best hand that I could with the cards that I was dealt. My brother started to take note of what I was doing and he said that I should stop, but who was he to tell me what to do? He owned a measly 30% of the business and I knew that at anytime I could oust him for what he was doing. I made him aware of the same fact. Even though I knew that I could oust him at anytime, I began getting worried about his concern over what I was doing. So I contacted my Lawyer and I told her that I was selling the business to my brother and I needed to re-document the Operating Agreement to account for the transfer of my equity. Following this I began practicing my brothers signature for the next three days in my apartment for 4 hours every day after I was done working. I needed it to be perfect. Every curve had to be accounted for, every break in his name had to be exact, and every single angle had to be identical to his actual signature. Once I received the Operating Agreement, I was ready to sign the copy. I sat down at my Office Desk at my house, took a deep breath, and attentively scribbled down the signature. I was always careful when it came to breaking the law. I made sure every single thing was accounted for. I quickly made two copies of the Operating agreement, one for my brother and one for me to keep. Then I put on my winter gloves, went to the nearest Best Buy and bought two USBs, one for me, and one for Jonathan, who is my brother. I made sure that I was wearing my good old winter gloves the whole time. Right when I got home I plugged in the USBs to my scanner and downloaded both copies of the Operating Agreement. Following this I walked into the kitchen, sat down at the table, pulled out my laptop, carefully placed the USB next to my laptop, and waited for my brother to get home. Right when my brother got home I started acting like I was frustrated that the USB would not work and asked my brother, Hey Jonathan, could you try to plug this USB into your computer to see if itll register? For some reason it wont register on my laptop. Jonathan replied, Yeah man, for sure. Let me just get a glass of water real quick. After he gulped down the water, while staring out the window into the cold, dark, winter night, he walked over to the kitchen table, opened up his laptop, which was conveniently sitting at the table at the time, picked up my USB, and plugged it into his laptop. To my and his surprise, his laptop registered the USB. Jonathan then said, Well it looks like it works. Want me to take it out now? I replied, Yeah bro, that would be great. Thanks, just set it on the table please.      </p>
